# RRT-Connect-Path-Planning
## Project Description  
This project implements an advanced path planning algorithm using RRT* Connect with additional rectangular bounds, inspired by BIT*, in a ROS Noetic environment. The implementation includes efficient trajectory generation using the Bresenham line algorithm and real-time plotting with Matplotlib for visualization. A KD-Tree is utilized to optimize the nearest neighbor search, enhancing efficiency and robustness in path planning computations.
